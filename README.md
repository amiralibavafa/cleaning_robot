# 🧹 Cleaning Robot  

A Python-based cleaning robot that navigates a grid to find and clean grey spaces using various search algorithms. Users can select the algorithm to determine the robot's pathfinding behavior.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Simulates a cleaning robot that searches for the optimal path to clean grey spaces  
- Supports multiple search algorithms:  
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  - **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  
  - **A* Search** (Euclidean & Manhattan heuristics)  
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**  
- Simple setup with no external dependencies  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Dependencies:** Standard Python libraries (no additional installations required)  

## 📌 Prerequisites  
- **Python 3.7 or newer** must be installed on your system  

## 💻 Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cleaning-robot.git
   cd cleaning-robot
2. Run the program:
   
   python vacuum_search.py
   
   You can also run the program using Python Launcher or Pycharm running vacuum_search.py
